The Kasper software system was designed and developed as part of a undergraduate capstone project at **Northern Arizona University** by a team of computer science majors. This project, whose goal was to imporve access to the kaguya hyperspectral image dataset, was sponsored by the **United States Geological Survey Astorgeology Science Center** ([usgs](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/)). Kaguya is a lunar orbiter launched by the Japanese Space Administration ([JAXA](http://global.jaxa.jp/press/2007/12/20071214_kaguya_e.html)) which was in operation from September 2007 to June 2009. The project was implemented through a novel three layer architecture consisting of a spatially enabled [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database, a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) based application server, and a [leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) map based frontend user interface. This architecture allows for large amounts of data to be streamed through the system dynamically.
